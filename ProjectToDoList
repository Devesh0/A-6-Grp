ROLES:
Martin: Map.
Devesh: General programming. 
Tomasz: Map/map obstacles.  
Josh: General programming. 
Guanshen: General programming?
Aiman: Spaceship parts + OOP code behind it (with Josh)

Spaceship parts:
- Fuel (http://goo.gl/3fTbdL)
- CPU (http://goo.gl/1BNZMC)
- Engine (http://goo.gl/mnGiX7)  
- Batteries (http://goo.gl/pjnqJP)
- Door 
- Antenna 
- Propulsion 

Map obstacles:
- Rocks (can't go through it)
- Wall (can't go through it)
- Sand (robot goes slower) 

Tasks: 

Week 4:
- Make sure everyone is on GIT and knows how to use it.
- Upload the UML diagram to GIT. Possibly edit it to fit new game idea. 
- Get the 6 zones set-up, be able to specify to the robot which zone to go to.
Week 5:
- Implement the different map zones from Martin/Tomasz.
- Implement the parts from Aiman into the map. 
- Create the code behind the different parts: name, type, value etc.
- Create an inventory button/option (possibly press "i" to bring it up. Shows the parts collected.)
- Set up the robot's path-finding: avoiding objects? 
Week 6: 
- Create a search system where the user specifies what order they find objects in (group requirement 2)
- Set up the robot's path-finding: locating most valuable objects? (group requirement 2)
- Create a system where the user specifies an amount of time to locate a certain item
- Create a sorting system in the ventory, allowing the user to order the items in levels of value and other criteria (group requirements)
- Create a system whereby after the robot runs out of fuel their items collected are displayed on screen. 

Week 7:
- Consult the group requirements and check that all requirements are met. 
- Testing: 
  - Play the game and try to emulate all scenarios.
  - Get somebody else to play it? 

Long term improvements after basic game implementation:
- A new game/save game option. (sql) 
- Different levels of difficulty?
